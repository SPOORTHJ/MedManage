This DBMS project specifies the requirements for the Hospital Management System (MedManage). The system allows hospital staff to manage patient records, appointments, and staff information through CRUD (Create,Read, Update, Delete) operations.
The MedManage system is designed for use by hospital administrative staff and healthcare professionals, providing a secure and user-friendly interface for managing hospital operations. It interacts with the hospital's central database to store and retrieve information.
